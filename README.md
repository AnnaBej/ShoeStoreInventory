# ShoeStoreInventory


Dear Udacity Mentor/ Reviewer,

Thank you for taking the time and your effort in reviewing this project. 
This is my first app done completly by myslef. I added some extra functionality as I would like to include this project into my portfolio. 

Unfortunately, this app isn't error-free as I am unable to sort out some problems. I reached out with questions in Udacity but I haven't recieved a reply there. 
I am hoping to recieve it here. 

The issues:
1. The camera and gallery intents work but they do not lead to the photo displaying in the designated area. 
+ I am unsure how to pass it to the recyclerView. - it's all in AddFragment

2. I would like the seekBar to be set up according to the nnumber of shoes left. I tried many things but none of them worked. - UpdateFragment 
I also asked the stackoverflow community for help. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69446955/how-can-i-set-up-the-progress-of-seekbar-according-to-a-number

Many thanks once again and best reagrds,
Anna
